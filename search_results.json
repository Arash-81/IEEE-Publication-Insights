        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad term that can be construed to mean a focusing computer programming and development that is designed to train machines and to perform task. Artificial intelligence can be used to test theories of reasoning like cognitive reasoning and consciousness. Research has been conducted on the development of machines with human behavior and cognitive characteristics that are related to consciousness. Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning that are dealt with, can necessarily solve problems related to mental health issues that humans find complex, but research on new interaction techniques and human for cooperation theories, technologies limited the issues and challenges facing the application of artificial reasoning. Here in this paper, the relation between artificial intelligence human reasoning that is also called as AI reasoning or artificial reasoning has been studied. Artificial intelligence impacts reasoning and how artificial reasoning can be used in day-to-day activities to regain our mental health. Moreover, this work focuses on problems that can be solved with AI Reasoning in trying to find the possible solutions.",

Artificial Intelligence improves a large application domain of software engineering activities. Intelligent knowledge discovery integrates Artificial Intelligence with Data Mining for intelligent computing of software engineering tasks. The integration of artificial intelligence with data mining for supporting software engineering applications leads to Software Intelligence. This paper analyzes three artificial intelligence techniques that uses data mining, business intelligence, machine learning for promoting automated software reuse for software construction and overall software development. The business intelligence tools are used for intelligent knowledge discovery of code that will be used for reusability of applications and components. An analysis of several AI techniques in software reuse domain of software engineering is discussed for automated software reuse and identification of potential research prospects in the field.",
