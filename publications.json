            "abstract": "With the in-depth development of intelligent technology, game artificial intelligence (AI) has become the technical core of improving the playability of a game and the main selling point of game promotion, deepening the game experience realm. Modern computer games achieve the realism of games by integrating graphics, physics and artificial intelligence. It is difficult to define the meaning of realistic game experience, but generally speaking, it usually refers to the immersion of the game and the intelligence of non-player characters in the game. As the technical core of improving game playability and the selling point of many commercial games, game artificial intelligence gives players a way to interact with non-player characters in the game, and promotes the realm of game experience to a higher level. Based on this, this paper analyzes the history and present situation of artificial intelligence in game development, and puts forward the possible changes and impacts of artificial intelligence technology based on machine learning on game development in the future.",

In the past, teachers mainly relied on relevant teaching materials to prepare lessons, but now teachers can use artificial intelligence technology to prepare lessons, which reduces the burden of preparing lessons for teachers. Artificial intelligence, referred to as AI for short, is a branch of computer science, and it is a discipline that studies how to make computers simulate people\u2019s thinking and intelligent behavior. The application of artificial intelligence in education can promote education equality and improve teaching efficiency. For example, in some remote mountain schools, educational resources are scarce. The application of artificial intelligence can integrate and share educational resources to the network platform to achieve education equality. Then, this paper analyzes and explores how to change the teaching methods in the future. Starting from the current situation of the development of artificial intelligence in China and combining with the current teaching, it continuously analyzes and studies the teaching methods incorporating artificial intelligence to promote the systematic reform and development of future teaching.",

Ethical challenges in the vast utilization of AI called for the progression of accountable artificial intelligence. This research aims to investigate the relationship between those organizational elements that affect the development of responsible artificial intelligence in an organization. Based on the synthesis of previous related research results, the conceptual model of the current research was developed. This research found that perceived organizational justice has a mediating role between organizational culture and the development of responsible artificial intelligence. In other words, by creating a rich organizational culture that leads to more perceived organizational justice, one can take a step toward the acceptable development of responsible artificial intelligence in an organization. Eventually, with the development of responsible artificial intelligence, we will witness the increasing benefits of artificial intelligence usage and its advantages in meeting personal and organizational needs with fewer challenges.",

Artificial intelligence mainly refers to the use of computer science and technology to imitate the ability of human intelligent behavior, such as language translation, voice recognition, and an interaction with the physical world through visual analysis and decision-making. With the continuous development of modern information technology, the integration of artificial intelligence and the sports industry will be an inevitable development trend. Therefore, the article takes the principle of artificial intelligence sensor as the basic basis and discusses the value of its use in the physical condition testing of athletes' training in order to improve the quality of athletes' training and thus promote their competition performance. Artificial intelligence technology can provide precise physical data to coaches and athletes, such as heart rate, muscle fatigue, and metabolic level. These data can help coaches better plan training programs, making training more scientific and personalized. At the same time, athletes can adjust their training methods based on the data, in order to maximize their potential.",

How to judge whether a machine or program has intelligence is an important problem. By studying the famous original paper \"computing machine and intelligence\" which proposed Turing test, and combining with the Chinese house thought experiment and the chat program Eliza experiment, this paper points out that the popular saying that Turing test is regarded as the standard to judge whether a machine has intelligence neither conforms to the actual research in artificial Intelligence, nor conform to the meaning expressed by Turing himself.

Currently, AI is increasingly being applied in various fields such as sports culture and sports industry, and has achieved rich results, playing a certain promoting role in realizing stronger, higher, and faster performance in the sports field. However, athletes are also prone to making incorrect movements during competitions and daily training, and judging the accuracy of movements through manual means can result in significant errors. With the continuous development of AI technology, using this technology to intelligently recognize incorrect movements can help improve the recognition rate of incorrect movements. Therefore, based on AI technology, this paper proposes a model for intelligent recognition of incorrect movements in athlete training. The model constructs formalized description rules for movement through three-dimensional coordinates and uses Bayesian algorithm to recognize incorrect movements, and finally verifies this system. The results show that this model can identify incorrect movements with high accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed for maxillofacial imaging and has been used more frequently in the last decade. The proposed research stated that unavailable or ineffective screening was the main cause of poor oral cancer outcomes. This ineffective screening can lead to delays in specialists\u2019 expertise and subsequent treatment. Other causes of delayed diagnoses are the lack of awareness of oral cancer in the public and the lack of access to health care services at the right time. More causes in delay of oral cancer may be lack of knowledge in performing biopsies or similar forms of diagnostic tests, no access to oral cancer treatment/referral centers, and lack of trained professionals who can diagnose and treat oral cancers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) should be integrated in the dental field, as proven by DentalXrai-Pro and Yomi (7). AI-machines help guide the dentists by uncovering oral cancers and diagnosing them in less time. This use can lead to immense growth in the dental field as patients are satisfied, costs are reduced, and the results of dental clinics improve. These various methods of detection like semantic segmentation, object detection, and image classification can help start the increased use of AI in the dental field. Additionally, the crossing of multiple fields of work like engineers, clinicians, and researchers can lead to the development of more focused and utilization of AI in the dental field.",

            "abstract": "Humans have invented intelligent machinery to enhance their rational decision-making procedure, which is why it has been named \u2018augmented intelligence\u2019. The usage of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is increasing enormously with every passing year, and it is becoming a part of our daily life. We are using this technology not only as a tool to enhance our rationality but also heightening them as the autonomous ethical agent for our future society. Norbert Wiener envisaged \u2018Cybernetics\u2019 with a view of a brain-machine interface to augment human beings' biological rationality. Being an autonomous ethical agent presupposes an \u2018agency\u2019 in moral decision-making procedure. According to agency's contemporary theories, AI robots might be entitled to some minimal rational agency. However, that minimal agency might not be adequate for a fully autonomous ethical agent's performance in the future. If we plan to implement them as an ethical agent for the future society, it will be difficult for us to judge their actual stand as a moral agent. It is well known that any kind of moral agency presupposes consciousness and mental representations, which cannot be articulated synthetically until today. We can only anticipate that this milestone will be achieved by AI scientists shortly, which will further help them triumph over \u2018the problem of ethical agency in AI\u2019. Philosophers are currently trying a probe of the pre-existing ethical theories to build a guidance framework for the AI robots and construct a tangible overview of artificial moral agency. Although, no unanimous solution is available yet. It will land up in another conflicting situation between biological, moral agency and autonomous ethical agency, which will leave us in a baffled state. Creating rational and ethical AI machines will be a fundamental future research problem for the AI field. This paper aims to investigate \u2018the problem of moral agency in AI\u2019 from a philosophical outset and hold a survey of the relevant...",

Currently, AI is increasingly being applied in various fields such as sports culture and sports industry, and has achieved rich results, playing a certain promoting role in realizing stronger, higher, and faster performance in the sports field. However, athletes are also prone to making incorrect movements during competitions and daily training, and judging the accuracy of movements through manual means can result in significant errors. With the continuous development of AI technology, using this technology to intelligently recognize incorrect movements can help improve the recognition rate of incorrect movements. Therefore, based on AI technology, this paper proposes a model for intelligent recognition of incorrect movements in athlete training. The model constructs formalized description rules for movement through three-dimensional coordinates and uses Bayesian algorithm to recognize incorrect movements, and finally verifies this system. The results show that this model can identify incorrect movements with high accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed for maxillofacial imaging and has been used more frequently in the last decade. The proposed research stated that unavailable or ineffective screening was the main cause of poor oral cancer outcomes. This ineffective screening can lead to delays in specialists\u2019 expertise and subsequent treatment. Other causes of delayed diagnoses are the lack of awareness of oral cancer in the public and the lack of access to health care services at the right time. More causes in delay of oral cancer may be lack of knowledge in performing biopsies or similar forms of diagnostic tests, no access to oral cancer treatment/referral centers, and lack of trained professionals who can diagnose and treat oral cancers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) should be integrated in the dental field, as proven by DentalXrai-Pro and Yomi (7). AI-machines help guide the dentists by uncovering oral cancers and diagnosing them in less time. This use can lead to immense growth in the dental field as patients are satisfied, costs are reduced, and the results of dental clinics improve. These various methods of detection like semantic segmentation, object detection, and image classification can help start the increased use of AI in the dental field. Additionally, the crossing of multiple fields of work like engineers, clinicians, and researchers can lead to the development of more focused and utilization of AI in the dental field.",

            "abstract": "Humans have invented intelligent machinery to enhance their rational decision-making procedure, which is why it has been named \u2018augmented intelligence\u2019. The usage of artificial intelligence (AI) technology is increasing enormously with every passing year, and it is becoming a part of our daily life. We are using this technology not only as a tool to enhance our rationality but also heightening them as the autonomous ethical agent for our future society. Norbert Wiener envisaged \u2018Cybernetics\u2019 with a view of a brain-machine interface to augment human beings' biological rationality. Being an autonomous ethical agent presupposes an \u2018agency\u2019 in moral decision-making procedure. According to agency's contemporary theories, AI robots might be entitled to some minimal rational agency. However, that minimal agency might not be adequate for a fully autonomous ethical agent's performance in the future. If we plan to implement them as an ethical agent for the future society, it will be difficult for us to judge their actual stand as a moral agent. It is well known that any kind of moral agency presupposes consciousness and mental representations, which cannot be articulated synthetically until today. We can only anticipate that this milestone will be achieved by AI scientists shortly, which will further help them triumph over \u2018the problem of ethical agency in AI\u2019. Philosophers are currently trying a probe of the pre-existing ethical theories to build a guidance framework for the AI robots and construct a tangible overview of artificial moral agency. Although, no unanimous solution is available yet. It will land up in another conflicting situation between biological, moral agency and autonomous ethical agency, which will leave us in a baffled state. Creating rational and ethical AI machines will be a fundamental future research problem for the AI field. This paper aims to investigate \u2018the problem of moral agency in AI\u2019 from a philosophical outset and hold a survey of the relevant...",

Currently, AI is increasingly being applied in various fields such as sports culture and sports industry, and has achieved rich results, playing a certain promoting role in realizing stronger, higher, and faster performance in the sports field. However, athletes are also prone to making incorrect movements during competitions and daily training, and judging the accuracy of movements through manual means can result in significant errors. With the continuous development of AI technology, using this technology to intelligently recognize incorrect movements can help improve the recognition rate of incorrect movements. Therefore, based on AI technology, this paper proposes a model for intelligent recognition of incorrect movements in athlete training. The model constructs formalized description rules for movement through three-dimensional coordinates and uses Bayesian algorithm to recognize incorrect movements, and finally verifies this system. The results show that this model can identify incorrect movements with high accuracy.",

            "abstract": "Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed for maxillofacial imaging and has been used more frequently in the last decade. The proposed research stated that unavailable or ineffective screening was the main cause of poor oral cancer outcomes. This ineffective screening can lead to delays in specialists\u2019 expertise and subsequent treatment. Other causes of delayed diagnoses are the lack of awareness of oral cancer in the public and the lack of access to health care services at the right time. More causes in delay of oral cancer may be lack of knowledge in performing biopsies or similar forms of diagnostic tests, no access to oral cancer treatment/referral centers, and lack of trained professionals who can diagnose and treat oral cancers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) should be integrated in the dental field, as proven by DentalXrai-Pro and Yomi (7). AI-machines help guide the dentists by uncovering oral cancers and diagnosing them in less time. This use can lead to immense growth in the dental field as patients are satisfied, costs are reduced, and the results of dental clinics improve. These various methods of detection like semantic segmentation, object detection, and image classification can help start the increased use of AI in the dental field. Additionally, the crossing of multiple fields of work like engineers, clinicians, and researchers can lead to the development of more focused and utilization of AI in the dental field.",

            "abstract": "Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) model trading has gained increasing attention from academia and industry. Although of great appeal, it poses a series of challenges when applied in decentralized collaborative trading scenarios. On the one hand, model owners should constantly fine-tune AI models to meet customized needs, which causes heavy updating overhead. On the other hand, collaborative AI model training results in copyright sharing between multiple owners, which necessitates differential AI model royalties to adapt to the development of trading market. To address these challenges, we design a smart contract aided dynamic multi-owner copyright scheme with hierarchical differential royalties for collaborative AI model trading. First, to meet the frequent updating requirements, we propose a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) driven dynamic AI model copyright protection structure, integrating InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and NFT to realize low-cost AI model updating. Second, a batch AI model trading smart contract is designed to further reduce the trading cost in high-frequency trading scenarios. Third, we establish a hierarchical differential royalties collection and allocation mechanism for multi-owner AI models, where the AI model royalties are adaptively adjusted over time, utilization frequency, and the number of customers, and are allocated differentially based on training contributions. Last but not least, we conduct comprehensive evaluation and analysis of our scheme, demonstrating its efficiency, availability and flexibility.",

            "abstract": "An unprecedented shift in technology has begun in the modern era. Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) advancements have created fresh positions while de-skilling or retraining many existing ones. Technical developments at higher education institutions (HEIs) protect students against potential changes in their field of study brought on by A) and prepare them for success in the workplace. This research aims to investigate how, over the past 150 years; globalization has fundamentally changed human civilization. Conventional education confronts enormous challenges as energy, the internet of things, and the cyber-physical systems they oversee diminish. One may argue that energy, the internet of things, and the cyber-physical systems that are under its jurisdiction are the foundations of all future education. The demise of these systems presents a significant threat to traditional schooling. Students' screen time is increased by this action, which has an impact on their mental health. Five-fold cross-validation with 210 students from Delhi NCR and abroad is beneficial for the classification techniques SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. The study examined the factors that contributed to an increased rate of mental health issues among undergraduate students in Delhi, India, following the introduction of the COVID-19 virus. The results have demonstrated that while technology\u2019s practical applications will likely have a positive influence on education in the future, there may be negative effects as well. This is an opportunity for educators and learners to support excellence and remove obstacles that prevent many kids and schools from achieving it. Therefore, in the future, every nation will need to create an education system that is more technologically sophisticated.",

The study use a dataset that encompasses a wide range of elements and practical training, such as behavioural characteristics, demographic data, and clinical markers linked to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The K-nearest neighbours (KNN) technique, renowned for its simplicity and efficacy in classification tasks, is used to examine patterns within the dataset and provide predictions pertaining to the probability of autism. The research starts with the first stage of data preparation, which access the processes of feature selection and normalisation. These steps are undertaken to optimise the performance of the model. Following this, a thorough assessment of the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) method is undertaken, taking into account various hyperparameter configurations and evaluating its efficacy in properly categorising and accessing people into Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and non-ASD groups. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in identifying subtle patterns within the dataset, so enhancing our comprehensive comprehension of the elements that influence the risk of autism. The study findings have broader significance outside the field of diagnostics, as the model\u2019s precision that was established has the capacity to support clinicians and researchers in identifying and intervening early with people who are at risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This work makes a valuable contribution to the continuing endeavours aimed at improving the accuracy and effectiveness of autism risk assessment via the integration of machine learning approaches. Ultimately, this research aims to provide timely and targeted therapies, leading to enhanced results.",

The increasing occurrence of oil spills presents a substantial danger to marine ecosystems, hence requiring expeditious and precise methodologies for detection. The suggested technique utilises the hierarchical feature learning capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to autonomously identify pertinent patterns from satellite photos. This enables the differentiation between oil spills and natural water characteristics. The use of a sequential design significantly improves the network's capacity to grasp spatial relationships and underlying patterns present in the picture. The article presents an evaluation of the efficacy of the constructed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by conducting thorough testing on various datasets. The results highlight the model's strong performance in accurately categorising oil spills, achieving a high accuracy rate of 96 percent. The use of neural networks in this particular context presents a potentially effective strategy for the prompt identification and monitoring of environmental risks, hence enabling timely intervention and mitigation measures.",

The field of synthetic media has grown so much beyond fake text into machine-generated images, audio, and video. This led to a new terminology called deepfakes. These are media developed by leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques with a purpose to modify existing content or create new ones.

It is referred as the palpation of the high-pressure wave of blood moving away from the heart through blood vessels in the extremities. The pulse morphology is seen to vary with respect to time in different individuals. Variations in morphology of peripheral pulse results in multiple disease conditions, which results in difficulty to diagnose accurately. Therefore, need to classify the different morphological patterns of peripheral pulse accurately. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been suggested for the classification of peripheral pulse morphologies obtained by Peripheral Pulse Analyzer (PPA). Around 2,200 images of eight different patterns of pulse waves are used for pattern classification. The images resulting from eight patterns are classified using three existing models of deep-CNN namely VGG16, VGG19 and ResNet50. To assess each Transfer Learning (TL) model's performance, five metrics are computed. Python is used in the implementation and training of the TL models. After testing the dataset, the accuracy of each instance was provided for VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50, which are 89.25%, 90.79%, and 91.23%, respectively. Resnet50 model has provided best result as compared to VGG16 and VGG19 models.",

            "abstract": "The photovoltaic effect has permanently transformed the landscape of renewable sources by making it possible to convert solar energy into useable power. This concept is based on solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, but current PV technology limits us to capturing just a small percentage of the sun's energy at any given time. However, productivity can be greatly increased by using solar monitoring equipment. Creating and validating a low-priced active dual-axis solar tracking system is a breeze if you follow the steps outlined in this article. The best orientation for solar panels is perpendicular to the sun because their production is directly related to the amount of light they receive. Conventional solar panels have trouble keeping up with the ever-changing ideal angle for sunlight absorption and energy gathering. By tracing the sun's movement across the sky, solar trackers can triple the effectiveness of solar panels. This technological advancement is expected to lead to an improvement in energy generation and overall efficiency. This state-of-the-art solar tracker is powered by LEDs and an Arduino Uno. These systems work together to follow the sun's motion and maintain the solar panels facing the appropriate way. To ensure that the solar panels receive the most amount of sunshine possible, the system will automatically adjust their angle. Data processing and analysis in LabVIEW demonstrated the improved efficiency of the novel architecture. Researchers discovered a remarkable 13.44% boost in energy production compared to conventional fixed solar PV systems.",

Histopathology images play a crucial role in diagnosing and predicting anomalies, yet human error remains a challenge in physical examinations. Deep learning algorithms offer advancements, aiding medical professionals by enhancing the accuracy of oral cancer identification from histopathology pictures. This study modifies three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, including two based on DENSENET-121, to discern photos containing both oral cancer and healthy cells. The experiment focuses on two classes: normal and malignant cells, with a global incidence rate of 7 for malignancy, a prevalent form of head and neck cancer. Traditional oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) diagnosis relies on time-consuming histological analysis, prone to human interpretation variations. Utilizing artificial intelligence techniques improves diagnostic accuracy, expediting precise diagnoses.

The merging of Raspberry Pi-controlled technology with cutting-edge Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models forms the basis of our groundbreaking breakthrough. The booth uses high-resolution imaging sensors to acquire detailed photographs of the user's skin, which are then analyzed in real-time by an ANN. The ability to identify potentially malignant anomalies in a timely and precise manner is made possible by this combination. In public places, user contact is facilitated by the use of an intuitive touchscreen interface, which ensures both accessibility and convenience of use. The ANN model, trained on a wide variety of data, is very good at differentiating between normal and malignant skin diseases, with the findings being instantly shown on the interface. Beyond its technological capabilities, our technology bears the prospect of broad application, which will turn screening for skin cancer into a preventative healthcare tool available to everyone.

This research employs the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Random Forest models on a rich dataset of photos of bitter orange leaves damaged by the various diseases. The model\u2019s performance is carefully evaluated using precision, recall, or F1-Score measures, allowing for a thorough study of its ability to distinguish between various leaf diseases. The results show that the model is accurate in the positive predictions, with precision values that range from 92.85% to 95.48%. High recall values ranging from 92.61% to 94.82% demonstrate its capacity to record actual incidences of each disease of the leaf. The F1-Score, a beautiful blend of the recall and accuracy, ranges from 93.11% to 94.67%, demonstrating balanced performance across distinct illness classes. The prevalence of every leaf disease within the dataset is revealed by the support values, providing significant information for handling the diseases in actual agricultural situations. The model\u2019s general success across multiple illness classes is reinforced by the macro-average, weighted on a typical basis, or micro-average metrics, which are constantly around 94.06%. The obtained accuracy of the 98% demonstrates the model\u2019s ability to accurately classify the majority of occurrences. These findings make an important contribution to the field of agricultural and the precision by providing a dependable method for early identification and intervention in citrus farming. The complete evaluation approach guarantees the model\u2019s resilience in the practical scenarios, promoting long-term citrus leaf disease control practices.",

The suggested solution uses a Decision Tree (DT) model and real-time data received from IoT sensors placed strategically around the facility to enable adaptive enhancements to cleaning processes. This system of sensors keeps tabs on a number of variables, including manufacturing schedules, environmental factors, and circulation. In real-time, the DT model may use this data to optimize cleaning locations, durations, and procedures, cutting down on wasteful downtime and resource usage without compromising cleanliness. When contrasted with conventional static cleaning methods, the adaptive cleaning system shows considerable gains in both sanitation efficiency and resource occupancy. Improving cleaning using IoT technology makes it more responsive and smart, which in turn makes production more efficient and less detrimental to the environment. It explains how the IoT and DT models worked together to make manufacturing processes more adaptable, under the lens of industrial hygiene.",

Many analysts are working hard to identify and prevent these risks. However, the most difficult aspect of cybersecurity is determining which computers and users are affected. These computers are connected to servers or monitored by them, but there are no clear indications that attackers are targeting specific users. It is critical for the organization to defend against both internal and external cyberattacks. Cyber security measures should be up to date is critical for protecting our organizations. External threats can be identified easily but to identify insider threats is a complex task. Recently, there has been an increased emphasis on computer security, particularly in developing internal risk detection systems. Artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, distributed computing, data mining, portable ledgers, and data discovery are some of the advanced methods that have gained popularity for mitigating insider risk. Each of these approaches is unique and takes insider threats into account to a varying degree. In this paper, we use different machine learning models to find out the insiders.",

Primary data is collected by circulating a structured questionnaire with five- point Likert scale questions through Google forms. Data is analyzed using percentage scores of responses. Reliability of the instrument is tested using Cronbach's alpha score. Analysis suggests that Government run online ed-tech platform is acceptable to the student's community in general. The research findings also state that students and parents are willing to receive degree education through use of Govt. ed-tech platform. However, they are concerned about the poor socio-cultural life on online platform. This paper will be useful to the ed-tech companies to gain insights for a Govt. affiliated ed-tech platform and related product development in India.",

The table below summarizes the classification findings for each attention level. The model has outstanding precision values that go from 93.68% to 94.71% across all attention levels. Precision denotes the fraction of accurately predicted positive cases among all expected positives, indicating the capacity of the model to reduce false positives. Recovery rates varied from 93.82% to 94.65%, indicating how well the model worked to determine precise precision. These regression coefficients demonstrate that every feature could be adequately described by the model. The F1 score, which ranges from 93.95% to 94.46% and carefully assesses both accuracy and less-than-perfect performance, is a measure of the model\u2019s prediction performance. They display the actual outcomes in terms of supportive values from the data set for each attention level. The model, which has between 865 and 950 supports, illustrates the efficacy of different care levels. Support rates are also supplied, which indicate the distribution of the interest rates in the data set. Furthermore, the weighted average and macro average accuracy test results indicate that the overall performance of the model is 94.24% and 94.23%, respectively. The model may perform well in novel scenarios, as seen by the micro-average accuracy of 94.24%, which is the total accuracy over all cases.",

The vast amounts of data produced by the fashion industry today can be analyzed using Big Data techniques to help with pattern recognition. Given the substantial volume of data available, the potential for utilizing Artificial Intelligence within this industry is vast. However, what if someone wants to purchase an outfit that only exists in their imagination? To address this, a recommendation system must prioritize delivering sustainable fashion recommendation outcomes aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. Most existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning model-based recommendation systems are based on the time-consuming task of analyzing vast quantities of previously collected user data. The problem can be addressed using a Fuzzy Inference System technique. By employing this technique, the goal of sustainable fashion will be achieved, along with the fact that the system can provide outfit recommendations by engaging in intelligent inquiry and posing relevant and well-informed queries before searching. This approach not only fosters innovation but also promotes quality of life and emphasizes environmental sustainability, sustainable production, and resource efficiency, reducing consumer levels of waste. Integrating recycling and sustainable practices into the fashion industry contributes to energy efficiency and sustainable management. The advancement of the recommendation system in terms of technology transfer will be a crucial focus for future research and development.",

            "abstract": "Within the domain of financial risk assessment, the accurate anticipation of bankruptcy has significant importance in safeguarding the stability of economic systems. One of the longstanding issues in this particular field pertains to unbalanced datasets, whereby the number of instances representing bankruptcy is much lower in comparison to non-bankrupt cases. The combination of Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) with logistic regression classification presents a robust approach to tackle the issue of class imbalance, resulting in improved predicted accuracy of models. Financial statistics often demonstrate a disparity in class distribution, whereby occurrences of bankruptcy are comparatively few in comparison to instances of solvency. The existing disparity and social policy are a significant obstacle for machine learning algorithms, since these models tend to exhibit a bias towards the dominant class, leading to less-than-ideal accuracy when forecasting the minority class (bankruptcy). The main aim of this study is to access the Logistic regression classifier in order to classify Bankruptcy detection. The target will be achieved by the use of SMOTE Analysis, a technique designed to address the issue of unbalanced data. The anticipated accuracy of 84 percent will be employed using the classification report and the confusion matrix, both of which will be utilised in the proposed research study to visualise the results.",

Through the use of Raspberry Pi, other advanced sensors, and AI algorithms, the system is able to accomplish extraordinary levels of autonomous movement, obstacle avoidance, and individualized user support. IaaS design and AWS makes dynamic scalability, fast data processing and seamless integration of cloud-based services much easier to achieve. The use of virtual computers, cloud storage, and the AWS Internet of Things service provide a solid basis for real-time communication and decision-making. AWS offers a variety of security measures and monitoring tools to guarantee the dependability of the system and the integrity of user data. This sophisticated combination of hardware and AWS Infrastructure as a Service not only establishes a new benchmark for intelligent wheelchair technology but also highlights the potential for adaptive, cloud-enabled assistive devices to greatly improve persons with restricted mobility and their quality of life.",

            "abstract": "This study uses a method based on machine learning to conduct a thorough analysis into the automatic categorization of illnesses affecting ginger leaves. The study focuses on eight distinct classes of ginger leaf diseases: Leaf Spot (Phyllosticta zingiberi), Yellow Leaf Roll (Ginger Yellows), Leaves Blight (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides), Bacterial Wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum), Rhizome Rot (Pythium spp.), Fusarium Wilt (Fusarium oxysporum), The powdery Mildew (Oidium spp.), and Anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.). The system of classification is evaluated using important performance indicators such as precision, recall, or F1-Score, which provide insight into the model's capacity to accurately identify every illness class. The total amount of instances for each class is indicated by the support values, ensuring a diverse as well as representative dataset for testing and training purposes. Precision ratings that range from 91.39% ability 94.44% demonstrate the model's ability to reliably categorise each condition. Furthermore, recall rates greater than 90% highlight the model's responsiveness in capturing cases of each disease type. The resulting F1-Score, which balances precision and recall, regularly averages 92.50%. Weighted average metrics, which account for class imbalances, show a total precision of 92.51%, validating the framework's robustness across several disease categories. The micro average, which treats all instances equally, is consistent with the general precision, confirming the model's dependability. According to the study, the suggested model for machine learning has a high level of reliability and generalizability. This makes it a useful tool for automated identification and categorization of ginger leaf diseases. This study advances agricultural and botanic practices by providing a realistic approach for early identification of diseases in ginger plants.",

Monitoring the health and classification of coffee plants is vital for optimizing yield and ensuring sustainable production. Coffee plants are very vulnerable to several diseases and pests. The long-term effects of excessive pesticide usage may enhance disease resistance, severely limiting coffee plants' ability to fend off infections. The goal of this project is to create a sophisticated system that employs a deep learning-based Sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to visualise and categorise coffee leaves. This study provides a unique method for visualising and categorising coffee leaves using a deep learning-based Sequential CNN model.

            "abstract": "Alopecia, also known as hair loss, is a term used to describe hair loss from the scalp or other parts of the body. It can be caused by a number of factors, such as genetics, hormonal fluctuations, illness or external stressors. The five typical types of hair loss are male pattern baldness, which is typically hereditary and hormonal, characterized by receding hairline and thinning of the crown, then female pattern baldness, which usually causes general thinning without noticeable receding of the hairline, especially the crown. Genetic and hormonal factors are involved. Next comes Alopecia Areata, which results in round bald spots caused by sudden patchy hair loss that the immune system has targeted in the hair follicle. Then there is Telogen Effluvium, which denotes temporary hair loss is caused by illness, stress or hormonal fluctuations, resulting in hair loss especially in the seam and hairline area. Finally, there is Traction Alopecia, which causes the hair to gradually fall out and results in tight combs or constant pulling. This study aims to utilize the AI-related methods to predict these above mentioned hair loss patterns.",

Each critical level's precision, recall, and F1-Score data were provided, providing insight into the model's capacity to distinguish between various severity levels. The system performs very well in this Important Level 1 example, with outstanding precision (92.31%) implying amazing prediction precision and recall (85.71%) exhibiting the potential to capture a considerable proportion of true positive occurrences. At this severity level, the F1-Score\u2014a composite recall and accuracy score\u2014is 88.89%, suggesting a balanced performance. The results of these investigations, which were carried out at Critical stages 2 through 5, demonstrated a variety of indicators of outcome that were generally reliable. The Macro Average yields means of 86.59%, 86.29%, then 86.37%, respectively, and provides a summary of achievement by average accuracy, recall, as well as F1-Score for all classes. For accuracy, memory, and F1-Score, the weighted average values are 86.57%, 86.30%, and 86.36%, respectively. It takes into consideration class differences and offers a more complex achievement rating. The total quantity of true positives, false alarms, as well as fake negatives over each class in the Micro Aggregate is added to get the corrected accuracy of 86.30%. Furthermore, the model's overall accuracy of 89.3456% demonstrates its ability to classify events correctly at all important severity levels. These figures provide a more comprehensive picture of the algorithm's capabilities and show how well it can categorise the illness's severity. The excellent accuracy ratings of the model demonstrate its practicality and reliability in detecting crucial thresholds within the studied data set. These evaluations also provide crucial information for evaluating the assessed categorization work and model update decisions.",

Neural networks and machine learning algorithms are very adept at processing large amounts of data, finding patterns, and producing precise predictions. AI has made medical diagnosis and illness prognosis better, particularly for Parkinson\u2019s disease. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven classifiers and neural network-based prediction systems for Parkinson\u2019s disease early detection and staging are two noteworthy applications. As new data is added, these systems can adapt and improve, making them valuable for medical research. Neural network-based Parkinson\u2019s disease prediction models have shown promise. These algorithms can analyse patient biomarkers, medical history, and demographics to predict disease development or progression. Thanks to their ability to find complex data connections, neural networks can make personalized predictions and improve early intervention and therapy. AI improves the accuracy, speed of diagnosis and prognosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Doctors need an accurate diagnosis to quickly initiate the appropriate medications and support programs. Neural network-based prediction models and AI-powered classifiers show promise in treating Parkinson\u2019s disease, but AI experts and doctors need to work together. To guarantee the dependability and generalizability of these cutting-edge techniques in clinical practice, data protection, ethical AI usage, and model validation across many patient groups are required. In order to correctly portray Parkinson\u2019s illness, the research suggests using five significant classifiers: logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, closest neighbours, and effective sequential neural networks. Among the five classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbour had the highest accuracy rate of 94%, while the sequential neural network predicted an accuracy rate of 90%.",

Such questions are of particular interest to educators, who worry that these tools enable a new form of academic dishonesty, in which students submit AI-generated code as their work. Our research explores the viability of using code stylometry and machine learning to distinguish between GPT-4 generated and human-authored code. Our dataset comprises human-authored solutions from CodeChef and AI-authored solutions generated by GPT-4. Our classifier outperforms baselines, with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.91. A variant of our classifier that excludes gameable features (e.g., empty lines, whitespace) still performs well with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.89. We also evaluated our classifier on the difficulty of the programming problem and found that there was almost no difference between easier and intermediate problems, and the classifier performed only slightly worse on harder problems. Our study shows that code stylometry is a promising approach for distinguishing between GPT-4 generated code and human-authored code.",

While prior work has examined model-level energy usage, the energy footprint of the dl frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, used to train and build these models, has not been thoroughly studied. We present Greenlight, a large-scale dataset containing fine-grained energy profiling information of 1284 TensorFlow api calls. We developed a command line tool called CodeGreen to curate such a dataset. CodeGreen is based on our previously proposed framework FECoM, which employs static analysis and code instrumentation to isolate invocations of TensorFlow operations and measure their energy consumption precisely. By executing api calls on representative workloads and measuring the consumed energy, we construct detailed energy profiles for the apis. Several factors, such as input data size and the type of operation, significantly impact energy footprints. Greenlight provides a ground-truth dataset capturing energy consumption along with relevant factors such as input parameter size to take the first step towards optimization of energy-intensive TensorFlow code. The Greenlight dataset opens up new research directions such as predicting api energy consumption, automated optimization, modeling efficiency trade-offs, and empirical studies into energy-aware dl system design.",

Through the incorporation of olfactory information, the automation of kitchen ventilation systems may be achieved. Considering cost constraints in consumer applications, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) sensors are preferred over expensive gas sensors as a more cost-effective option. Since no comparable dataset for this application existed, a custom dataset was recorded using a specifically developed data logger and labeling tool. A sensor node combines six different sensor types which were used to record cooking situations in eight apartment kitchens with a total of 18 GB of measurement data (VOC, temperature, relative humidity, scattered light). As an initial attempt, a simple Artificial Intelligence (AI) odor classifier was developed. It can distinguish between four different odors by using 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on time series. The model was quantized to 8 Bit after training and was ported to an Arm Cortex-M4 microcontroller platform. It performs with an F1-score of over 55% (median) in unseen kitchens, requires 183 KB of RAM memory and takes 35 s of inference time.",

Outdoor gas source localization is highly challenging because of the large fluctuations of the wind. Combination of a gas sensor network and a deep-learning pattern recognition model is expected to provide high accuracy in estimating a gas source location. However, collecting sufficient amount of gas sensor data for training a neural network model can be extremely laborious. Here we propose to use the simulator to generate the training data. Gas distributions trailing from its source in various directions are simulated by rotating the wind data measured in an outdoor environment. The temporal waveform of each sensor response in a stationary gas sensor network is calculated by feeding the simulated gas concentration values to a second-order sensor response model. The sensor response data is then used to train a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) to estimate the location of the gas source. The high-accuracy results demonstrate the effectiveness of augmenting the training data using the gas dispersion simulator.",

Simulation results show that the proposed control scheme tracks the PMSM speed at specified values and compensates the effect of load torque.

The integration of computer vision with compact processing systems and cameras in Stereo configuration, using Python and OpenCV as tools to deploy the mathematical model and of IA Stereo BGM, enables disparity calculation, obstacle detection, and tactile feedback through vibration. Additionally, still using OpenCV as a computer vision tool, the YOLO AI model incorporates a touch-activated image caption feature, which combined with the information generated by the aforementioned disparity calculations makes it possible, through a text-to-speech engine, to make this function even more complete.

The proposed solution is reduced to the use of a diagonal stabilization of the state observer and uses the stable form of the Metzler matrix decomposition. Moreover, a problem parameterization of such residual fault filters is solved by adapting the task to the incomplete positivity of the structure of such systems. The proposed approach creates a unified framework that covers the compactness of the parametric constraints of the Metzler matrix, the structurally constrained state of the observer and its quadratic stability. Due to the complexity of such constraints, the design conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an example is given to show the superiority and practicality of the proposed fault detection scheme.",

Initially, to determine which of a quadrotor\u2019s four actuators is failing, a quaternion neural network observer is created. The quadrotor dynamic model includes the DC motor dynamics, which is taken into account when designing the fault-tolerant observer. The quaternion neural network presents four failure modes pertaining to an actuator state in which instability and divergence from the healthy state occur when one of the actuators fails. Next, a fault-tolerant terminal sliding mode controller is engineered to deliver the necessary controller action when all actuators are functioning normally, or if one or more quadrotor UAV actuators malfunction. The rapid terminal sliding mode controller is built in order to acquire the diverse control laws when one or many actuators fail or when the system is in healthy state. The suitable Lyapunov functional at various time instants is taken into account throughout the construction of this fault-tolerant controller to restore optimal performance. In addition to the theoretical outcomes of this investigation, a simulation is run to demonstrate the effectiveness of the observer/controller approach and to contrast it with other sliding mode and neural network observer/controller combinations. The research study\u2019s conclusions and discussions are given at the end.",

When a person is drowsy, their vigilance and reaction time can be significantly reduced, increasing the risk of driving errors, lack of attention, and even falling asleep at the wheel. Yawning is often associated with fatigue and can be a sign of imminent drowsiness. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) can help mitigate these risks by providing innovative solutions. For example, drowsiness detection systems using AI technologies can analyze biometric signals, such as eye movements or heart rate, to detect signs of fatigue in the driver. When drowsiness is detected, the system can emit audible or vibratory warnings to alert the driver and recommend taking a break.",

            "abstract": "Turbine blades, which carry approximately one-third of a turbine weight, are susceptible to damage and can cause sudden malfunction of a grid-connected wind energy conversion system. Early detection of blade damage is crucial for preventing catastrophic failures that can lead to downtime, repair costs, and even injury or loss of life. This manuscript aims to explore an image analytics-based deep learning framework for wind turbine blade erosion detection. Turbine blade images are captured via drones/unmanned aerial vehicles during the data collection phase. Upon inspection, it was found that the image dataset was limited; hence, image augmentation was applied to improve the blade image dataset. The approach is modeled as a multiclass supervised learning problem where different turbine blade surface damage scenarios are considered. The potential capability of transfer learning methods such as VGG16-RCNN and AlexNet are tested against a convolutional neural network for detecting the blade\u2019s surface damage. Results reveal the VGG16-RCNN model as the best classifier among the tested ones with the highest accuracy and precision score. To validate the effect of image augmentation on the training data, the accuracy of the proposed VGG16-RCNN framework is assessed via sensitivity analysis, and results of the same reveal that horizontal and vertical flip together with zoom and rotation brings out an efficiency of 93.8%. However, a more generic model that works well with turbines located in different topological regions could be of more importance.",

            "abstract": "Few-shot learning represents a paradigm shift in deep learning, which is defined by massive amounts of data and computing capacity. It solves these issues by utilizing novel training approaches and optimization goals. This shift also applies to meta-learning and provides an alternative to standard deep learning, which requires a lot of resources. The conventional technique indirectly infers the underlying structure between classes in the context of classification problems. In contrast, this work attempts to clearly portray the links between classes, which is a substantial change from previous techniques. This study looks into embedding adaptability for novel data in a high computing power environment. This is accomplished by investigating a dynamic interaction between samples utilizing their centroids inside a support. To better capture the subtle interactions between classes, this study uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in conjunction with attention processes. The ability to explicitly characterize class relationships boosts the flexibility and efficacy of few-shot learning, demonstrating how it can turn limited input and processing resources into maximum results. The research extends the potential of deep learning in situations where large-scale datasets and powerful computers are not readily available, offering up new avenues for real-world applications.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this work is to study how Deep Learning approaches solve safety problems in the interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Three object detection algorithms based on Deep Learning are proposed. These different proposed algorithms can provide good results that can accurately predict accidents related to road safety. These algorithms are very close in terms of accuracy, precision and F1- score, which is why we chose the recall term in the comparison to focus on the false negative, which is the most important in our case. The algorithm chosen, which is ResNet50, shows the best performance in terms of recall with a value of 98.5%, i.e. an improvement of at least 1.1% compared with the algorithms included in the comparative simulations (CNN and VGG16). It can therefore used to be recognize and identify pedestrians. In conclusion, this study shows that Deep Learning approaches, in particular the use of the ResNet50 algorithm, offer a promising solution for improving safety in interactions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians.",

The key concept underlying this approach involves formulating a non-integer order Thau-Luenberger Observer (NIO-TLO) designed specifically for the NIO-MM. This observer is developed to handle situations where both known and unknown inputs are subject to uncertainties, and the model itself incorporates bounded unknown inputs. The analysis of the convergence of the error of the state estimation is presented through the formulation of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

With this focus, we employ the K-Means clustering algorithm to group the learners based on similar needs and preferences and identified that distinguishing clusters can be formed within the DHH group. We also tried to understand the significant features contributing to forming well separated groups.

These controllers are designed to manage rotation angles and altitude, aiming to stabilize the quadrotor. The controllers were developed within the MATLAB Simulink environment, utilizing blocks supported by HDL Coder. PID parameters were fine-tuned through the PID Tuner feature. The control strategy was subsequently implemented on a Zybo FPGA board, employing the HDL Workflow Advisor to assess the controllers' behavior in FIL mode.

            "abstract": "In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, several concepts have emerged alongside this new revolution, such as predictive maintenance, which today plays a key role in sustainable manufacturing and production systems by introducing a digital version of machine maintenance. Data extracted from production processes has increased exponentially due to the proliferation of sensing technologies. Even if maintenance 4.0 faces organizational, financial or even data source and machine repair challenges, it remains a strong point for companies that use it. It minimizes machine downtime and associated costs, maximizes machine life-cycle, and improves production quality and throughput. This approach is generally characterized by a very precise workflow, starting with project understanding and data collection, and ending with the decision-making phase. Maintenance operations in a multifunctional production system, like other activities, can have a significant impact on overall system efficiency. To better highlight the effects of maintenance on system performance, it is necessary to define specific indicators that will enable in-depth analysis. A literature review is therefore undertaken to gather relevant information on the potential impact of maintenance in this system. As part of this review, it is crucial to identify the concrete aspects of maintenance that could significantly influence system performance, and to determine the parameters to be taken into account to assess these effects. The aim of this study is therefore to highlight gaps in the existing literature and to propose solutions, including adaptations in other areas such as maintenance and operations management, that could improve the performance of the multifunctional production system.",

            "abstract": "In the past few years, the emergence of artificial intelligence combined with the surface electromyography (sEMG) paved the way to the development of smart and wearable electronic systems for human-machine interaction. However, the monitoring and the classification of surface electromyography signals remain a difficult task due to their inherently stochastic nature and substantial variability. Several models for analyzing and classifying sEMG signals have been assessed such as Convolutional Neural Networks [1], Support Vector Machines [2], and other classical machine learning algorithms [3], [4]. Although these approaches provide acceptable performance, a hardware implementation of such machine learning models in energy-efficient in-memory-computing architectures remains very challenging. Then, we developed an alternative brain-inspired learning algorithm based on High-Dimensional Computing. In this work, we propose a comprehensive comparative analysis of classifiers for gesture recognition using surface electromyographic signals of the largest public database existing at the time [5]. After a preprocessing of those signals and an optimization of hyperparameters, we show that our High-Dimensional Computing model outperforms the performance of well-established classification algorithms. For the first time, we implemented a new temporal encoder based solely on addition operation (no permutation) for the formation of Ngram sequences. The ability of our model to recognize hand, wrist, grasping and functional movements on the most comprehensive benchmark scientific databases (Ninapro) is demonstrated with high accuracy (up to 85.6%), exceeding the performance of usual machine learning algorithms.",

Indeed, \"The benefits of digitalizing the supply chain are numerous, including flexibility and responsiveness of the chain, cost minimization, enhancement of operational efficiency, reduction of errors and delays in processes, improvement of product visibility and traceability, data security, and enhancement of customer experience.\" However, the digitalization of the supply chain contributes to both strategic and operational excellence. Despite its crucial importance for competitiveness, there is a lack of experts capable of implementing Smart Supply Chains and intelligent technologies within the supply chain. Therefore, this article will address the advantages and implications of adopting intelligent technologies in supply chain management. The main objective of this research is to analyze the mediating effect of operational and strategic levers of Smart Supply Chain and intelligent technologies on supply chain performance.

            "abstract": "Quality control in Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) poses challenges due to the complex nature of its underlying processes, making it difficult to identify defects during the welding operations. Conventional post-weld inspections, including non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are inefficient and restrict real-time process optimization. This study introduces a novel deep learning-based multimodal approach for real-time GMAW quality monitoring. The proposed solution integrates electrical data, including sensor readings such as voltage (V), current (I) and gas flow rate (GFR) along with high-resolution welding images captured by an advanced welding camera. To enhance the representation for the vision encoder model, timeseries sensor data is converted into spectrograms. The EfficientNetB2 pretrained model stands out as a balanced choice as a vision encoder, achieving high accuracy of 97.33% with a relatively efficient design in terms of both parameters and inference speed. In contrast, ResNet50 achieves the highest accuracy at 98.67%, but it comes with increased complexity and longer inference times. Moreover, comparative analysis underscores the effectiveness of our multimodal approach in achieving superior results over unimodal approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach extends its applicability to Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), providing a comprehensive solution for monitoring and enhancing quality control across various welding methods.",

The focus is on damping resonance frequencies in a cantilever beam's first and second modes. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed Randomized Inertia PSO (RPSO) algorithm, employing an indirect approach based on input and output data in the frequency domain. The RPSO algorithm exhibits accelerated convergence and reduced anomalies compared to its non-randomized counterpart, NRPSO. The transient response of the controlled system to impulse excitation demonstrates successful attenuation of both modes simultaneously. Comparative analyses of frequency responses and pole-zero plots, considering various optimization criteria, illuminate the behavior of the RPSO algorithm, displaying characteristics similar to H 2 , H \u221e , and Stability Max optimization. These findings emphasize the potential of RPSO in achieving desired control outcomes in dynamic systems, underscoring its significance in engineering applications.",

Firstly, UDE is introduced, and then the ANFTSM control scheme is designed with a NTFSM surface.

Such questions are of particular interest to educators, who worry that these tools enable a new form of academic dishonesty, in which students submit AI-generated code as their work. Our research explores the viability of using code stylometry and machine learning to distinguish between GPT-4 generated and human-authored code. Our dataset comprises human-authored solutions from CodeChef and AI-authored solutions generated by GPT-4. Our classifier outperforms baselines, with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.91. A variant of our classifier that excludes gameable features (e.g., empty lines, whitespace) still performs well with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.89. We also evaluated our classifier on the difficulty of the programming problem and found that there was almost no difference between easier and intermediate problems, and the classifier performed only slightly worse on harder problems. Our study shows that code stylometry is a promising approach for distinguishing between GPT-4 generated code and human-authored code.",

While prior work has examined model-level energy usage, the energy footprint of the dl frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, used to train and build these models, has not been thoroughly studied. We present Greenlight, a large-scale dataset containing fine-grained energy profiling information of 1284 TensorFlow api calls. We developed a command line tool called CodeGreen to curate such a dataset. CodeGreen is based on our previously proposed framework FECoM, which employs static analysis and code instrumentation to isolate invocations of TensorFlow operations and measure their energy consumption precisely. By executing api calls on representative workloads and measuring the consumed energy, we construct detailed energy profiles for the apis. Several factors, such as input data size and the type of operation, significantly impact energy footprints. Greenlight provides a ground-truth dataset capturing energy consumption along with relevant factors such as input parameter size to take the first step towards optimization of energy-intensive TensorFlow code. The Greenlight dataset opens up new research directions such as predicting api energy consumption, automated optimization, modeling efficiency trade-offs, and empirical studies into energy-aware dl system design.",

Through the incorporation of olfactory information, the automation of kitchen ventilation systems may be achieved. Considering cost constraints in consumer applications, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) sensors are preferred over expensive gas sensors as a more cost-effective option. Since no comparable dataset for this application existed, a custom dataset was recorded using a specifically developed data logger and labeling tool. A sensor node combines six different sensor types which were used to record cooking situations in eight apartment kitchens with a total of 18 GB of measurement data (VOC, temperature, relative humidity, scattered light). As an initial attempt, a simple Artificial Intelligence (AI) odor classifier was developed. It can distinguish between four different odors by using 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on time series. The model was quantized to 8 Bit after training and was ported to an Arm Cortex-M4 microcontroller platform. It performs with an F1-score of over 55% (median) in unseen kitchens, requires 183 KB of RAM memory and takes 35 s of inference time.",

Outdoor gas source localization is highly challenging because of the large fluctuations of the wind. Combination of a gas sensor network and a deep-learning pattern recognition model is expected to provide high accuracy in estimating a gas source location. However, collecting sufficient amount of gas sensor data for training a neural network model can be extremely laborious. Here we propose to use the simulator to generate the training data. Gas distributions trailing from its source in various directions are simulated by rotating the wind data measured in an outdoor environment. The temporal waveform of each sensor response in a stationary gas sensor network is calculated by feeding the simulated gas concentration values to a second-order sensor response model. The sensor response data is then used to train a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) to estimate the location of the gas source. The high-accuracy results demonstrate the effectiveness of augmenting the training data using the gas dispersion simulator.",

Simulation results show that the proposed control scheme tracks the PMSM speed at specified values and compensates the effect of load torque.

Additionally, still using OpenCV as a computer vision tool, the YOLO AI model incorporates a touch-activated image caption feature, which combined with the information generated by the aforementioned disparity calculations makes it possible, through a text-to-speech engine, to make this function even more complete.

The proposed solution is reduced to the use of a diagonal stabilization of the state observer and uses the stable form of the Metzler matrix decomposition. Moreover, a problem parameterization of such residual fault filters is solved by adapting the task to the incomplete positivity of the structure of such systems. The proposed approach creates a unified framework that covers the compactness of the parametric constraints of the Metzler matrix, the structurally constrained state of the observer and its quadratic stability. Due to the complexity of such constraints, the design conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an example is given to show the superiority and practicality of the proposed fault detection scheme.",

Initially, to determine which of a quadrotor\u2019s four actuators is failing, a quaternion neural network observer is created. The quadrotor dynamic model includes the DC motor dynamics, which is taken into account when designing the fault-tolerant observer. The quaternion neural network presents four failure modes pertaining to an actuator state in which instability and divergence from the healthy state occur when one of the actuators fails. Next, a fault-tolerant terminal sliding mode controller is engineered to deliver the necessary controller action when all actuators are functioning normally, or if one or more quadrotor UAV actuators malfunction. The rapid terminal sliding mode controller is built in order to acquire the diverse control laws when one or many actuators fail or when the system is in healthy state. The suitable Lyapunov functional at various time instants is taken into account throughout the construction of this fault-tolerant controller to restore optimal performance. In addition to the theoretical outcomes of this investigation, a simulation is run to demonstrate the effectiveness of the observer/controller approach and to contrast it with other sliding mode and neural network observer/controller combinations. The research study\u2019s conclusions and discussions are given at the end.",

When a person is drowsy, their vigilance and reaction time can be significantly reduced, increasing the risk of driving errors, lack of attention, and even falling asleep at the wheel. Yawning is often associated with fatigue and can be a sign of imminent drowsiness. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) can help mitigate these risks by providing innovative solutions. For example, drowsiness detection systems using AI technologies can analyze biometric signals, such as eye movements or heart rate, to detect signs of fatigue in the driver. When drowsiness is detected, the system can emit audible or vibratory warnings to alert the driver and recommend taking a break.",

            "abstract": "Turbine blades, which carry approximately one-third of a turbine weight, are susceptible to damage and can cause sudden malfunction of a grid-connected wind energy conversion system. Early detection of blade damage is crucial for preventing catastrophic failures that can lead to downtime, repair costs, and even injury or loss of life. This manuscript aims to explore an image analytics-based deep learning framework for wind turbine blade erosion detection. Turbine blade images are captured via drones/unmanned aerial vehicles during the data collection phase. Upon inspection, it was found that the image dataset was limited; hence, image augmentation was applied to improve the blade image dataset. The approach is modeled as a multiclass supervised learning problem where different turbine blade surface damage scenarios are considered. The potential capability of transfer learning methods such as VGG16-RCNN and AlexNet are tested against a convolutional neural network for detecting the blade\u2019s surface damage. Results reveal the VGG16-RCNN model as the best classifier among the tested ones with the highest accuracy and precision score. To validate the effect of image augmentation on the training data, the accuracy of the proposed VGG16-RCNN framework is assessed via sensitivity analysis, and results of the same reveal that horizontal and vertical flip together with zoom and rotation brings out an efficiency of 93.8%. However, a more generic model that works well with turbines located in different topological regions could be of more importance.",

            "abstract": "Few-shot learning represents a paradigm shift in deep learning, which is defined by massive amounts of data and computing capacity. It solves these issues by utilizing novel training approaches and optimization goals. This shift also applies to meta-learning and provides an alternative to standard deep learning, which requires a lot of resources. The conventional technique indirectly infers the underlying structure between classes in the context of classification problems. In contrast, this work attempts to clearly portray the links between classes, which is a substantial change from previous techniques. This study looks into embedding adaptability for novel data in a high computing power environment. This is accomplished by investigating a dynamic interaction between samples utilizing their centroids inside a support. To better capture the subtle interactions between classes, this study uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in conjunction with attention processes. The ability to explicitly characterize class relationships boosts the flexibility and efficacy of few-shot learning, demonstrating how it can turn limited input and processing resources into maximum results. The research extends the potential of deep learning in situations where large-scale datasets and powerful computers are not readily available, offering up new avenues for real-world applications.",

            "abstract": "The aim of this work is to study how Deep Learning approaches solve safety problems in the interaction between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Three object detection algorithms based on Deep Learning are proposed. These different proposed algorithms can provide good results that can accurately predict accidents related to road safety. These algorithms are very close in terms of accuracy, precision and F1- score, which is why we chose the recall term in the comparison to focus on the false negative, which is the most important in our case. The algorithm chosen, which is ResNet50, shows the best performance in terms of recall with a value of 98.5%, i.e. an improvement of at least 1.1% compared with the algorithms included in the comparative simulations (CNN and VGG16). It can therefore used to be recognize and identify pedestrians. In conclusion, this study shows that Deep Learning approaches, in particular the use of the ResNet50 algorithm, offer a promising solution for improving safety in interactions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians.",

The key concept underlying this approach involves formulating a non-integer order Thau-Luenberger Observer (NIO-TLO) designed specifically for the NIO-MM. This observer is developed to handle situations where both known and unknown inputs are subject to uncertainties, and the model itself incorporates bounded unknown inputs. The analysis of the convergence of the error of the state estimation is presented through the formulation of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

With this focus, we employ the K-Means clustering algorithm to group the learners based on similar needs and preferences and identified that distinguishing clusters can be formed within the DHH group. We also tried to understand the significant features contributing to forming well separated groups.

These controllers are designed to manage rotation angles and altitude, aiming to stabilize the quadrotor. The controllers were developed within the MATLAB Simulink environment, utilizing blocks supported by HDL Coder. PID parameters were fine-tuned through the PID Tuner feature. The control strategy was subsequently implemented on a Zybo FPGA board, employing the HDL Workflow Advisor to assess the controllers' behavior in FIL mode.

            "abstract": "In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, several concepts have emerged alongside this new revolution, such as predictive maintenance, which today plays a key role in sustainable manufacturing and production systems by introducing a digital version of machine maintenance. Data extracted from production processes has increased exponentially due to the proliferation of sensing technologies. Even if maintenance 4.0 faces organizational, financial or even data source and machine repair challenges, it remains a strong point for companies that use it. It minimizes machine downtime and associated costs, maximizes machine life-cycle, and improves production quality and throughput. This approach is generally characterized by a very precise workflow, starting with project understanding and data collection, and ending with the decision-making phase. Maintenance operations in a multifunctional production system, like other activities, can have a significant impact on overall system efficiency. To better highlight the effects of maintenance on system performance, it is necessary to define specific indicators that will enable in-depth analysis. A literature review is therefore undertaken to gather relevant information on the potential impact of maintenance in this system. As part of this review, it is crucial to identify the concrete aspects of maintenance that could significantly influence system performance, and to determine the parameters to be taken into account to assess these effects. The aim of this study is therefore to highlight gaps in the existing literature and to propose solutions, including adaptations in other areas such as maintenance and operations management, that could improve the performance of the multifunctional production system.",

However, the monitoring and the classification of surface electromyography signals remain a difficult task due to their inherently stochastic nature and substantial variability. Several models for analyzing and classifying sEMG signals have been assessed such as Convolutional Neural Networks [1], Support Vector Machines [2], and other classical machine learning algorithms [3], [4]. Although these approaches provide acceptable performance, a hardware implementation of such machine learning models in energy-efficient in-memory-computing architectures remains very challenging. Then, we developed an alternative brain-inspired learning algorithm based on High-Dimensional Computing. In this work, we propose a comprehensive comparative analysis of classifiers for gesture recognition using surface electromyographic signals of the largest public database existing at the time [5]. After a preprocessing of those signals and an optimization of hyperparameters, we show that our High-Dimensional Computing model outperforms the performance of well-established classification algorithms. For the first time, we implemented a new temporal encoder based solely on addition operation (no permutation) for the formation of Ngram sequences. The ability of our model to recognize hand, wrist, grasping and functional movements on the most comprehensive benchmark scientific databases (Ninapro) is demonstrated with high accuracy (up to 85.6%), exceeding the performance of usual machine learning algorithms.",

Conventional post-weld inspections, including non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are inefficient and restrict real-time process optimization. This study introduces a novel deep learning-based multimodal approach for real-time GMAW quality monitoring. The proposed solution integrates electrical data, including sensor readings such as voltage (V), current (I) and gas flow rate (GFR) along with high-resolution welding images captured by an advanced welding camera. To enhance the representation for the vision encoder model, timeseries sensor data is converted into spectrograms. The EfficientNetB2 pretrained model stands out as a balanced choice as a vision encoder, achieving high accuracy of 97.33% with a relatively efficient design in terms of both parameters and inference speed. In contrast, ResNet50 achieves the highest accuracy at 98.67%, but it comes with increased complexity and longer inference times. Moreover, comparative analysis underscores the effectiveness of our multimodal approach in achieving superior results over unimodal approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach extends its applicability to Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), providing a comprehensive solution for monitoring and enhancing quality control across various welding methods.",

The focus is on damping resonance frequencies in a cantilever beam's first and second modes. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed Randomized Inertia PSO (RPSO) algorithm, employing an indirect approach based on input and output data in the frequency domain. The RPSO algorithm exhibits accelerated convergence and reduced anomalies compared to its non-randomized counterpart, NRPSO. The transient response of the controlled system to impulse excitation demonstrates successful attenuation of both modes simultaneously. Comparative analyses of frequency responses and pole-zero plots, considering various optimization criteria, illuminate the behavior of the RPSO algorithm, displaying characteristics similar to H 2 , H \u221e , and Stability Max optimization. These findings emphasize the potential of RPSO in achieving desired control outcomes in dynamic systems, underscoring its significance in engineering applications.",

Such questions are of particular interest to educators, who worry that these tools enable a new form of academic dishonesty, in which students submit AI-generated code as their work. Our research explores the viability of using code stylometry and machine learning to distinguish between GPT-4 generated and human-authored code. Our dataset comprises human-authored solutions from CodeChef and AI-authored solutions generated by GPT-4. Our classifier outperforms baselines, with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.91. A variant of our classifier that excludes gameable features (e.g., empty lines, whitespace) still performs well with an F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 0.89. We also evaluated our classifier on the difficulty of the programming problem and found that there was almost no difference between easier and intermediate problems, and the classifier performed only slightly worse on harder problems. Our study shows that code stylometry is a promising approach for distinguishing between GPT-4 generated code and human-authored code.",

While prior work has examined model-level energy usage, the energy footprint of the dl frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, used to train and build these models, has not been thoroughly studied. We present Greenlight, a large-scale dataset containing fine-grained energy profiling information of 1284 TensorFlow api calls. We developed a command line tool called CodeGreen to curate such a dataset. CodeGreen is based on our previously proposed framework FECoM, which employs static analysis and code instrumentation to isolate invocations of TensorFlow operations and measure their energy consumption precisely. By executing api calls on representative workloads and measuring the consumed energy, we construct detailed energy profiles for the apis. Several factors, such as input data size and the type of operation, significantly impact energy footprints. Greenlight provides a ground-truth dataset capturing energy consumption along with relevant factors such as input parameter size to take the first step towards optimization of energy-intensive TensorFlow code. The Greenlight dataset opens up new research directions such as predicting api energy consumption, automated optimization, modeling efficiency trade-offs, and empirical studies into energy-aware dl system design.",

Through the incorporation of olfactory information, the automation of kitchen ventilation systems may be achieved. Considering cost constraints in consumer applications, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) sensors are preferred over expensive gas sensors as a more cost-effective option. Since no comparable dataset for this application existed, a custom dataset was recorded using a specifically developed data logger and labeling tool. A sensor node combines six different sensor types which were used to record cooking situations in eight apartment kitchens with a total of 18 GB of measurement data (VOC, temperature, relative humidity, scattered light). As an initial attempt, a simple Artificial Intelligence (AI) odor classifier was developed. It can distinguish between four different odors by using 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on time series. The model was quantized to 8 Bit after training and was ported to an Arm Cortex-M4 microcontroller platform. It performs with an F1-score of over 55% (median) in unseen kitchens, requires 183 KB of RAM memory and takes 35 s of inference time.",

Outdoor gas source localization is highly challenging because of the large fluctuations of the wind. Combination of a gas sensor network and a deep-learning pattern recognition model is expected to provide high accuracy in estimating a gas source location. However, collecting sufficient amount of gas sensor data for training a neural network model can be extremely laborious. Here we propose to use the simulator to generate the training data. Gas distributions trailing from its source in various directions are simulated by rotating the wind data measured in an outdoor environment. The temporal waveform of each sensor response in a stationary gas sensor network is calculated by feeding the simulated gas concentration values to a second-order sensor response model. The sensor response data is then used to train a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) to estimate the location of the gas source. The high-accuracy results demonstrate the effectiveness of augmenting the training data using the gas dispersion simulator.",

Simulation results show that the proposed control scheme tracks the PMSM speed at specified values and compensates the effect of load torque.

The proposed solution is reduced to the use of a diagonal stabilization of the state observer and uses the stable form of the Metzler matrix decomposition. Moreover, a problem parameterization of such residual fault filters is solved by adapting the task to the incomplete positivity of the structure of such systems. The proposed approach creates a unified framework that covers the compactness of the parametric constraints of the Metzler matrix, the structurally constrained state of the observer and its quadratic stability. Due to the complexity of such constraints, the design conditions are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, an example is given to show the superiority and practicality of the proposed fault detection scheme.",

Initially, to determine which of a quadrotor\u2019s four actuators is failing, a quaternion neural network observer is created. The quadrotor dynamic model includes the DC motor dynamics, which is taken into account when designing the fault-tolerant observer. The quaternion neural network presents four failure modes pertaining to an actuator state in which instability and divergence from the healthy state occur when one of the actuators fails. Next, a fault-tolerant terminal sliding mode controller is engineered to deliver the necessary controller action when all actuators are functioning normally, or if one or more quadrotor UAV actuators malfunction. The rapid terminal sliding mode controller is built in order to acquire the diverse control laws when one or many actuators fail or when the system is in healthy state. The suitable Lyapunov functional at various time instants is taken into account throughout the construction of this fault-tolerant controller to restore optimal performance. In addition to the theoretical outcomes of this investigation, a simulation is run to demonstrate the effectiveness of the observer/controller approach and to contrast it with other sliding mode and neural network observer/controller combinations. The research study\u2019s conclusions and discussions are given at the end.",

When a person is drowsy, their vigilance and reaction time can be significantly reduced, increasing the risk of driving errors, lack of attention, and even falling asleep at the wheel. Yawning is often associated with fatigue and can be a sign of imminent drowsiness. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) can help mitigate these risks by providing innovative solutions. For example, drowsiness detection systems using AI technologies can analyze biometric signals, such as eye movements or heart rate, to detect signs of fatigue in the driver. When drowsiness is detected, the system can emit audible or vibratory warnings to alert the driver and recommend taking a break.",

            "abstract": "Turbine blades, which carry approximately one-third of a turbine weight, are susceptible to damage and can cause sudden malfunction of a grid-connected wind energy conversion system. Early detection of blade damage is crucial for preventing catastrophic failures that can lead to downtime, repair costs, and even injury or loss of life. This manuscript aims to explore an image analytics-based deep learning framework for wind turbine blade erosion detection. Turbine blade images are captured via drones/unmanned aerial vehicles during the data collection phase. Upon inspection, it was found that the image dataset was limited; hence, image augmentation was applied to improve the blade image dataset. The approach is modeled as a multiclass supervised learning problem where different turbine blade surface damage scenarios are considered. The potential capability of transfer learning methods such as VGG16-RCNN and AlexNet are tested against a convolutional neural network for detecting the blade\u2019s surface damage. Results reveal the VGG16-RCNN model as the best classifier among the tested ones with the highest accuracy and precision score. To validate the effect of image augmentation on the training data, the accuracy of the proposed VGG16-RCNN framework is assessed via sensitivity analysis, and results of the same reveal that horizontal and vertical flip together with zoom and rotation brings out an efficiency of 93.8%. However, a more generic model that works well with turbines located in different topological regions could be of more importance.",

            "abstract": "Few-shot learning represents a paradigm shift in deep learning, which is defined by massive amounts of data and computing capacity. It solves these issues by utilizing novel training approaches and optimization goals. This shift also applies to meta-learning and provides an alternative to standard deep learning, which requires a lot of resources. The conventional technique indirectly infers the underlying structure between classes in the context of classification problems. In contrast, this work attempts to clearly portray the links between classes, which is a substantial change from previous techniques. This study looks into embedding adaptability for novel data in a high computing power environment. This is accomplished by investigating a dynamic interaction between samples utilizing their centroids inside a support. To better capture the subtle interactions between classes, this study uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in conjunction with attention processes. The ability to explicitly characterize class relationships boosts the flexibility and efficacy of few-shot learning, demonstrating how it can turn limited input and processing resources into maximum results. The research extends the potential of deep learning in situations where large-scale datasets and powerful computers are not readily available, offering up new avenues for real-world applications.",

Three object detection algorithms based on Deep Learning are proposed. These different proposed algorithms can provide good results that can accurately predict accidents related to road safety. These algorithms are very close in terms of accuracy, precision and F1- score, which is why we chose the recall term in the comparison to focus on the false negative, which is the most important in our case. The algorithm chosen, which is ResNet50, shows the best performance in terms of recall with a value of 98.5%, i.e. an improvement of at least 1.1% compared with the algorithms included in the comparative simulations (CNN and VGG16). It can therefore used to be recognize and identify pedestrians. In conclusion, this study shows that Deep Learning approaches, in particular the use of the ResNet50 algorithm, offer a promising solution for improving safety in interactions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians.",

The key concept underlying this approach involves formulating a non-integer order Thau-Luenberger Observer (NIO-TLO) designed specifically for the NIO-MM. This observer is developed to handle situations where both known and unknown inputs are subject to uncertainties, and the model itself incorporates bounded unknown inputs. The analysis of the convergence of the error of the state estimation is presented through the formulation of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).

With this focus, we employ the K-Means clustering algorithm to group the learners based on similar needs and preferences and identified that distinguishing clusters can be formed within the DHH group. We also tried to understand the significant features contributing to forming well separated groups.

These controllers are designed to manage rotation angles and altitude, aiming to stabilize the quadrotor. The controllers were developed within the MATLAB Simulink environment, utilizing blocks supported by HDL Coder. PID parameters were fine-tuned through the PID Tuner feature. The control strategy was subsequently implemented on a Zybo FPGA board, employing the HDL Workflow Advisor to assess the controllers' behavior in FIL mode.

            "abstract": "In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, several concepts have emerged alongside this new revolution, such as predictive maintenance, which today plays a key role in sustainable manufacturing and production systems by introducing a digital version of machine maintenance. Data extracted from production processes has increased exponentially due to the proliferation of sensing technologies. Even if maintenance 4.0 faces organizational, financial or even data source and machine repair challenges, it remains a strong point for companies that use it. It minimizes machine downtime and associated costs, maximizes machine life-cycle, and improves production quality and throughput. This approach is generally characterized by a very precise workflow, starting with project understanding and data collection, and ending with the decision-making phase. Maintenance operations in a multifunctional production system, like other activities, can have a significant impact on overall system efficiency. To better highlight the effects of maintenance on system performance, it is necessary to define specific indicators that will enable in-depth analysis. A literature review is therefore undertaken to gather relevant information on the potential impact of maintenance in this system. As part of this review, it is crucial to identify the concrete aspects of maintenance that could significantly influence system performance, and to determine the parameters to be taken into account to assess these effects. The aim of this study is therefore to highlight gaps in the existing literature and to propose solutions, including adaptations in other areas such as maintenance and operations management, that could improve the performance of the multifunctional production system.",

However, the monitoring and the classification of surface electromyography signals remain a difficult task due to their inherently stochastic nature and substantial variability. Several models for analyzing and classifying sEMG signals have been assessed such as Convolutional Neural Networks [1], Support Vector Machines [2], and other classical machine learning algorithms [3], [4]. Although these approaches provide acceptable performance, a hardware implementation of such machine learning models in energy-efficient in-memory-computing architectures remains very challenging. Then, we developed an alternative brain-inspired learning algorithm based on High-Dimensional Computing. In this work, we propose a comprehensive comparative analysis of classifiers for gesture recognition using surface electromyographic signals of the largest public database existing at the time [5]. After a preprocessing of those signals and an optimization of hyperparameters, we show that our High-Dimensional Computing model outperforms the performance of well-established classification algorithms. For the first time, we implemented a new temporal encoder based solely on addition operation (no permutation) for the formation of Ngram sequences. The ability of our model to recognize hand, wrist, grasping and functional movements on the most comprehensive benchmark scientific databases (Ninapro) is demonstrated with high accuracy (up to 85.6%), exceeding the performance of usual machine learning algorithms.",

Conventional post-weld inspections, including non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are inefficient and restrict real-time process optimization. This study introduces a novel deep learning-based multimodal approach for real-time GMAW quality monitoring. The proposed solution integrates electrical data, including sensor readings such as voltage (V), current (I) and gas flow rate (GFR) along with high-resolution welding images captured by an advanced welding camera. To enhance the representation for the vision encoder model, timeseries sensor data is converted into spectrograms. The EfficientNetB2 pretrained model stands out as a balanced choice as a vision encoder, achieving high accuracy of 97.33% with a relatively efficient design in terms of both parameters and inference speed. In contrast, ResNet50 achieves the highest accuracy at 98.67%, but it comes with increased complexity and longer inference times. Moreover, comparative analysis underscores the effectiveness of our multimodal approach in achieving superior results over unimodal approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach extends its applicability to Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), providing a comprehensive solution for monitoring and enhancing quality control across various welding methods.",

The focus is on damping resonance frequencies in a cantilever beam's first and second modes. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed Randomized Inertia PSO (RPSO) algorithm, employing an indirect approach based on input and output data in the frequency domain. The RPSO algorithm exhibits accelerated convergence and reduced anomalies compared to its non-randomized counterpart, NRPSO. The transient response of the controlled system to impulse excitation demonstrates successful attenuation of both modes simultaneously. Comparative analyses of frequency responses and pole-zero plots, considering various optimization criteria, illuminate the behavior of the RPSO algorithm, displaying characteristics similar to H 2 , H \u221e , and Stability Max optimization. These findings emphasize the potential of RPSO in achieving desired control outcomes in dynamic systems, underscoring its significance in engineering applications.",

The developed UDE -ANFTSMC controller not only uses the advantages of NFTSM theory to ensure fast convergence speed, avoid singularity and robustness to uncertainties and external disturbances, but also uses UDE to estimate and suppress unknown disturbances in the system. Firstly, UDE is introduced, and then the ANFTSM control scheme is designed with a NTFSM surface. Lyapunov stability theory was used for stability analysis, and the manipulator mathematic model and SolidWorks\u2019 prototype were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",
